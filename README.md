# Plank Sack Tracker
A plugin designed to perform best-effort tracking of the contents of the plank sack and show an overlay of the current contents.

The plugin supports tracking individual plank types in the sack, but is most reliable when the contents are limited to one type at a time. 
It provides configuration options to show or hide the overlay, warning messages (and an overlay for) when it detects a likely miscount, and settings for the overlay text and color.
